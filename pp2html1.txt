                    <p> Childhood is a time of unfiltered wonder, where every day feels like a new adventure. It’s the feeling of grass under bare feet, the thrill of running until you’re breathless, and the joy of finding treasures in places others overlook. It’s the scent of rain-soaked earth or the warmth of a summer afternoon spent playing with friends.

              Joy's Teenage years are like walking through a whirlwind of change and discovery. It’s that strange in-between time where you're not quite a child, but you're also not fully an adult. There’s a constant mix of freedom and uncertainty—freedom to explore, to make mistakes, and to chase after things you want, but also the weight of trying to figure out who you are in the middle of shifting friendships, new responsibilities, and a lot of firsts.

        <p>Adulthood comes with freedom, but also with the weight of decisions. You start to feel the consequences of the risks you’ve taken and the things you’ve put off. Some dreams evolve into practical realities, while others might shift or fade, making room for new ones. It’s a time where you start to understand the value of time—how precious it is and how little there sometimes feels like you have. You learn what it truly means to be independent, but also how important it is to rely on others.

With practice, you learn how to anticipate your opponent’s moves, how to execute different types of shots (like smashes, drops, or clears), and how to adjust your tactics depending on the match.</p>
